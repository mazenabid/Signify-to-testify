I like keeping it simple and straightforward especially when it comes to this project.

Through my research on the demographic of people who donate the most in Canada, I discovered that older individuals are more likely to donate.

Given this information, I now comprehend why many other donating websites I examined appear to follow this trend by having a basic design and not 
incorporating any intricate CSS or playful elements. Instead, they maintain a serious tone, which makes sense given the nature of the project we are 
working on. 

 As a result, I created this sitemap and a (low-fi) prototype, drawing inspiration from websites such as 

Inspiration
UNHCR
ISLAMIC RELIEF
GO FUND ME
GIVE SEND GO
UNESCO
WORLD VISION


The prototype followed People-Centered-Design ideas such as:

1- Constraints (logical)
  * it's spatial & Functional and follows natural mapping
  * Nort American Mapping Technique (cultural Constraint)

2- Gestalt. 
  * In terms of discoverability, the design makes sense and every box is evenly spaced out in the prototype

3- Affordance. 
  * I included the pay now button that moves you to the second page in figma when presenting the prototype


In summary, the prototype embodies the vision for the project, allowing us to get a sense of what the project will look like before diving 
into the details and bringing it to life.
